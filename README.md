# 🚦 **Traffic Light System Using 555 Timer IC**
# 📌**Introduction**

This project demonstrates a **Traffic Light Controller** built using **NE555 Timer ICs** operating in astable mode. The system simulates real-world traffic light sequencing using analog timing circuits.

The project is ideal for:

• Electronics beginners

• Engineering students

• Analog circuit learners

• Practical lab demonstrations

# 🎯 **Objectives**

• Understand 555 timer operation in astable mode

• Learn RC timing calculations

• Implement sequential LED switching

• Simulate real-world traffic light logic

• Gain hands-on circuit design experience

# 🧠 **Main Concept**

The **NE555 timer** is configured in **astable multivibrator mode**, meaning it continuously generates square wave pulses without any external triggering.

The time period is determined by:

T = 0.693 (R₁ + 2R₂) C

By selecting appropriate resistor and capacitor values, different delay intervals are created for traffic light transitions.
